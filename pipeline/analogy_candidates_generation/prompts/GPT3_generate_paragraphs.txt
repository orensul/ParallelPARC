Your task is to write a paragraph given SUBJECT and RELATIONS.
PARAGRAPH has to include RELATIONS in the text.
Inputs: SUBJECT, RELATIONS
Outputs: PARAGRAPH

Inputs:
SUBJECT: How does the electrical circuit work?
RELATIONS:
(battery, generates, electrical voltage)
(electrons, move through, copper wire)
(resistor, decrease, voltage rate)
Outputs:
PARAGRAPH:
The battery generates electrical voltage.
This voltage creates a potential difference that causes electrons to flow through the circuit.
The electrical voltage causes electrons to move through the copper wire.
The electrons pass through the resistor.
The resistor presents a higher resistance to the flow of electrons,
which causes a decrease in the voltage of the circuit.
