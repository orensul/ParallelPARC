Your task is to find an analogy between BASE and TARGET.
Here are the instructions for the format of relations you should provide in SIMILAR_RELATIONS.
Every similar relation should be in the following format: (ENTITY1_BASE, VERB_BASE, ENTITY2_BASE)
like (ENTITY1_TARGET, VERB_TARGET, ENTITY2_TARGET)
ENTITY1_BASE and ENTITY2_BASE must be noun phrases from BASE.
ENTITY1_TARGET and ENTITY2_TARGET must be noun phrases from TARGET.
VERB_BASE and VERB_TARGET must be verbs with the same meanings.
Inputs: BASE, TARGET_DOMAIN
Outputs: TARGET, TARGET_FIELD, SIMILAR_RELATIONS

Inputs:
BASE: How does the electrical circuit works?
TARGET_DOMAIN: One of the fields of Engineering
Outputs:
TARGET: How does a mechanical system of water pump works?
TARGET_FIELD: Mechanical Engineering
SIMILAR_RELATIONS:
(battery, generates, electrical voltage) like (pump, generates, pressure)
(electrons, move through, copper wire) like (water, move through, pipe)
(resistor, decrease, voltage rate) like (valve, decrease, flow rate)
