77,948How does the hydrologic cycle works?,"The water cycle is driven by the energy from the sun. The sun's energy causes liquid water from oceans and lakes to evaporate and transform into water vapor. The water vapor then rises into the atmosphere, where it condenses and forms clouds.

Some of the precipitation runs off into rivers or streams, while some of it evaporates and returns to the atmosphere.","Water evaporates from the ground up to the sky.
